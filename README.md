# Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Objective
To analyze sales performance across regions, products, and customers using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for data visualization.

## Tools Used
- SQL (for data cleaning, joins, aggregations)
- Power BI (for dynamic dashboards and DAX functions)
- GitHub (for documentation and version control)

## Project Files
- `Sales_Analysis_Dashboard.pbix` – Main dashboard file
- `db_dump.sql` – SQL dump used to generate the data
- `Screenshots/` – Sample visuals from the dashboard

## Dashboard Features
- Total Sales, Average Order Value, Order Count KPIs
- Region-wise and Product Category-wise performance
- Monthly sales trend charts
- Customer segmentation insights
- Slicers for region, category, and sales representatives

## Key Business Insights
- Region A had the highest total sales but the lowest AOV — potential for bundling offers.
- Product Category Y contributed to high returns — suggests QC issues or mismatch in positioning.
- Top 10% of customers accounted for ~60% of revenue — ripe for loyalty/retention efforts.

## Use Case
The dashboard helps business teams understand where to focus marketing, optimize inventory, and identify profitable customer segments for targeted growth.
